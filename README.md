# The **Clock** Strikes _**Colors**_

##Multilayed Project
..*For this project we were given a basic.gif file (see below)*

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CarmenChico/ClockofColors/master/basic.gif)

We were asked to render the code using Javascript and scss to replicate such picture and action (the digital clock changing including seconds)

..*The second part was to duplicate a second gif file (hex.gif: see below)*

With this hex image we were challenged to make the background colors change in sequence of seconds, and transition from showing the time, to showing the hex values.
