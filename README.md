# The **Clock** Strikes _**Colors**_

##Multi-layed Project
###Part 1
For this project we were given a basic.gif file (see below) to replicated.

We were asked to provide the code necessary using Javascript and .scss to replicate such picture and action (the digital clock changing by the second )

###Part 2 within 1
The second part was to duplicate a different hex.gif file (see below) and asked to follow-up with additional code to duplicate.

With this hex image we were challenged to make the background colors change in sequence of seconds, and transition from showing the time, to showing the correlating hex values instead.
